						h2.limit-block-box-title Limitless learning, more possibilities
						h3.limit-block-box-slogan The University of Rochester is one of the country's top-tier research universities. Our campuses are home to 200 academic majors, more than 2,000 faculty and instructional staff, and some 10,000 studentsâ€”approximately half of whom are women.
						h3.limit-block-box-slogan Learning at the University of Rochester is also on a very personal scale. Rochester remains one of the smallest and most collegiate among top research universities, with smaller classes, a low 10:1 student to teacher ratio, and increased interactions with faculty.
